This project was created with [Better-T-Stack](https://github.com/AmanVarshney01/create-better-t-stack), a modern TypeScript stack that combines , Hono, ORPC, and more.

## Features

- **TypeScript** - For type safety and improved developer experience
- **TailwindCSS** - Utility-first CSS for rapid UI development
- **shadcn/ui** - Reusable UI components
- **Hono** - Lightweight, performant server framework
- **oRPC** - End-to-end type-safe APIs with OpenAPI integration
- **Bun** - Runtime environment
- **Prisma** - TypeScript-first ORM
- **PostgreSQL** - Database engine
- **Husky** - Git hooks for code quality
- **Turborepo** - Optimized monorepo build system

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```
## Database Setup

This project uses PostgreSQL with Prisma.

1. Make sure you have a PostgreSQL database set up.
2. Update your `apps/server/.env` file with your PostgreSQL connection details.

3. Generate the Prisma client and push the schema:
```bash
bun db:push
```


Then, run the development server:

```bash
bun dev
```



The API is running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
